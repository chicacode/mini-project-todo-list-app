## Objective
Create a simple to-do list application that allows users to add, remove, and view tasks. Additionally, implement a feature to
suggest tasks based on priority and approaching deadlines using basic AI logic.
This project helps practice working with lists and functions in Python.

## Description
This console-based to-do list application provides a menu for users to manage their tasks. The application allows users to:
1. Add a task to the to-do list.
2. Remove a task from the to-do list.
3. View all tasks in the to-do list.
4. Suggest Tasks: Suggest tasks based on priority and approaching deadlines.
5. Exit the application.

## Features
- **Add Task:** Users can add a new task to the list.
- **Remove Task:** Users can remove a task from the list.
- **View Tasks:** Users can display all tasks in the list.
- **Suggests Tasks: based on priority and deadline
- **Exit:** Users can terminate the program.

## Implementation Steps
1. Initialize an empty list to store tasks.
2. Create functions for adding, removing, and viewing tasks.
3. Implement a menu that continuously prompts the user until they choose to exit.
4. Handle invalid inputs gracefully to improve user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: A core programming language for the project.
- **Datetime**: Used for date handling.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/chicacode/mini-project-todo-list-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd mini-project-todo-list-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```sh

   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```sh
   python todo_list.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script to access the to-do list menu.
2. Select options to **add**, **remove**, suggest, or **view** tasks.
3. Enter "4" to **exit** the application.

## Example Output
```
To-Do List Application
----------------------
1. Add Task

Enter your choice:
```

## Future Improvements
- Implement a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt.
- Mark Tasks as Complete.
- Store tasks in a file or database for persistence.
